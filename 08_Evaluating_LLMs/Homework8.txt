I think an interesting potential use case of LLMs in science would be to study nuclear reactions. Specifically, there are theorized ‘islands of stability’ that suggest that even heavier elements that are currently known could be formed and survive for a few thousands of a second before decaying. In principle, it seems that it could be possible to describe the “language” of nuclear processes to a large language model, and tell it the rules of physics that allow certain reactions to happen and to see if it can find pathways to creating new elements. A possible way of evaluating the LLM would be to see if it could reproduce known chains of reactions that have been discovered.
